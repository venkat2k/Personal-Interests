		<br>
		The first successful orbital launch was Sputnik 1 by the USSR on 4th October, 1957. The USA and the USSR were the pioneers in the early ages of space travel primarily due to the cold war. At the peak of the cold war, the USA landed a human on the moon. This remains one of the most important milestones in the history of space travel.
		<p>The first successful human spaceflight was Vostok 1 ("East 1"), carrying 27-year-old Russian cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin on 12 April 1961. The spacecraft completed one orbit around the globe, lasting about 1 hour and 48 minutes. Gagarin's flight resonated around the world; it was a demonstration of the advanced Soviet space program and it opened an entirely new era in space exploration</p>
		<p>The first artificial object to reach another celestial body was Luna 2 reaching the Moon in 1959</p>

		<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 14px"> The International Space Station</p>
		The following few decades saw a drastic improvement in the space technology. Several space agencies from around the globe invested heavily in space exploration. Several missions to planets near and far were planned, launched and succeeded. One of those is the ISS, The International Space Station. It was possible due to the multi-national effort from countries all over the world (notable ones include NASA and the ESA) and it remains as the most expensive man-made object at $150 billion USD. It is still operational to date. Astronauts conduct several scientific experiments to study the effects of gravity on our bodies. Other space stations that serve similar purposes are Mir, Tiangong, LOP-G.

		<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 14px;"> The Chandra X-ray Observatory</p>
		Space missions to explore places that are beyond the reach of humans play a significant role in our understanding of the universe. Some of the notable ones include the Hubble space telescope, Kepler space telescope, Chandra X-Ray Observatory. These extremely powerful telescopes made breakthrough discoveries of interstellars objects that are far far away and thus help us in studying the early ages of the Universe.
