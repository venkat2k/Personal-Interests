			<p class = "desc"> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Several countries made plans to visit the moon in the form of satellites and rovers but none of them come close to the landing of humans on the surface of the moon. On July 20th, 1969, the Apollo 11 crew became the first humans to set foot on the lunar soil. The mission was successful. The crew landed, surveyed the lunar surface, conducted a few more experiments and took some photos before heading back to the earth safely. The mission was fueled by the cold war. There was a space race between the USA and the USSR as to who would land a human on the moon before the other does. A series of crewed missions were launched to the moon and in total only 24 men have set foot on the moon. </p>

			<p class="desc"> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The Voyager 1 and 2 are the 2 most distant man made objects from the earth. Both of them were launched in the year 1977. The primary missions were to explore the gas giants Jupiter and Saturn. After making a series of discovering there, it was decided that the 2 probes be sent to the deep space in different directions. Voyager 1 was the first one to leave the solar system in the year 2012. Both of them are headed towards the neighboring stars and aren't expected to reach them anywhere soon. </p>

			<p class = "desc">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The Hubble Space Telescope is one of the finest works of mankind. It was launched in the year 1990. Ever since its launch it made startling discoveries through photos that no human can see. Some of the notable achievements of the telescope were The Hubble Deep Field and the Hubble Ultra Deeo Field images. The images revealed never before seen perspective of our early universe. The Hubble Space Telescope is still operational and is expected to be succeded by the James Webb Telescope</p>

It was built by the combined efforts of NASA, ESA, Roscosmos, JAXA and the CSA. It is the most expensive man made object and it costed over $150 billion USD. It supports scientific research, study of human body under the influence of zero gravity. It provides a long-term environment where studies can be performed potentially for decades. Humans are transported to and from the space station by the use of space shuttles.</p>
