	<h1>Space Exploration</h1>
	<br><br>
	<q><i>Space exploration is the discovery and exploration of celestial structures in outer space by developing and growing space technology. While the study of space is carried out mainly by astronomers with telescopes, the physical exploration of space is conducted both by unmanned robotic space probes and human spaceflight.</i></q>
	<br><br><br>
	<p>For long since the discovery of telescopes humans were intrigued by the concept of space beyond the earth. For several centuries astronomers made discoveries of planets, stars, galaxies, constellations. Their progress was limited by the fact that they cannot be reached. In the later part of 1950s, since the invention of rockets, the progress has been exceptional from being in orbit for a few hours to stepping foot on the moon in 20 years. </p>
	<p>Although space exploration is expensive, they provide us with priceless insights on how and why we exist. Over the years, questions have been raised on the amount of money spent on space exploration. I would say it was all worth it and it is worth even more. This website discusses the history, achievements and the future of space exploration briefly. </p>
