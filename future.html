	The future of space exploration is exiciting. With more space agencies both private and government funded coming into play, it can only get better. 
	Some of the upcoming missions are :

	<p>There are several other remarkable missions that are planned but have not been listed here.</p>
	<br>
	<p>The huge hindrance in the exploration of interstellar objects is distance. The current rocket propulsion system can only work so well that reaching the nearest star would take serveral hundreds of thousands of years. There are constantly new inventions and discoveries and with the technology advancing at the current pace, the technology for far space travels is only generations away. </p>

	<p>Several technologies advancements are being made in the industry by both government and private organizations. Rockets are getting powerful and versatile and some companies such as SpaceX, BlueOrigins are working on reusable rockets. SpaceX has successfully launched several satellites using resuable rockets in the recent years.</p>

	<br>
	<p>SpaceX has planned a commercial trip to the moon in 2023. It is called the dearMoon project conceived and financed by Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa.</p>
	<p>Breaking the distance barrier in long distance space travels requires more than just chemical propelled rockets. Scientists are working on several technologies to develop faster rockets. Some of them use nuclear energy as fuel. </p>
	<p>Breakthrough Starshot is a research and engineering project by the Breakthrough Initiatives to develop a proof-of-concept fleet of light sail spacecraft named StarChip, to be capable of making the journey to the Alpha Centauri star system 4.37 light-years away.</p>
