# Project 0  cs50 - Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

This project is based on one of my personal interests which is space exploration. I have made a simple website to describe the various aspects of space exploration.

There are 4 pages in the website. Each one describes one of the following:
1. Introduction
2. History
3. Achievements
4. Future

Each file has a brief description of its title and some images related to them.
